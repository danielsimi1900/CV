                <p>I am an experienced and focussed individual, currently seeking employment in a new and challenging role. I have excellent communication skills when working as part of a team, and my experience in kitchens has given me an ability to be proactive and work unsupervised. I have excellent practical skills in both catering and in ICT. I also have high levels of accuracy and attention to detail and I am happy to take on any training required. </p>
